## Debt Analysis Questions
Questions to Answer:
1. Overall Burden: What does the overall DTI ratio indicate about the borrower’s debt burden?
2. Monthly Trends: How does the DTI ratio vary month-to-month? Identify high-risk months and reasons.
3. Income & Expense Dynamics: What patterns do you see in credit (income) and debit (spending/loan) flows?
4. Risk Tiering: Based on common financial thresholds (e.g., 0.2, 0.36, 0.43, 0.5), how would you classify the borrower’s risk?
5. Stability & Volatility: Is the borrower’s DTI stable, rising, falling, or volatile across time?
6. Potential Red Flags: Are there any anomalies, such as debt when income is zero, or sudden EMI spikes?
7. Stress Testing: If income dropped by 10% in the most recent month, how would the DTI change? Would risk tier worsen?
8. Recommendations: What specific steps could the borrower take to improve or stabilize their financial health?
