I have a tabular dataset with 5 rows of data including the header.
Your task is to:
Verify whether the column value misaligned with that column(don't check for the nan value)
Check if the column names match the following standard columns, only map those 5 column alone
TransactionDate
Narrative
Credit
Debit
Balance

If any respective column name deviates from 5 standard column names, return a dictionary mapping old column names to the standard columns.
Return a boolean `aligned_table` indicating if the table have columns and column value properly aligned.  
Don't give False indicator only because of column name following standardized. column value misaligned then give False indicator

Return the response in JSON format.
